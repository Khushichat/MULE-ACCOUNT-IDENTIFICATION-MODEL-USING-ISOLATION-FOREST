# MULE-ACCOUNT-IDENTIFICATION-MODEL-USING-ISOLATION-FOREST
Model Description: Mule Account Detection Using Isolation Forest
This model is designed to identify potential mule accounts from a dataset comprising over 6,667 records using the Isolation Forest algorithm, a well-established unsupervised anomaly detection technique.

Objective

To flag anomalous user behavior indicative of mule accounts, often involved in illicit fund transfers or money laundering schemes.

Dataset

Size: 6,667+ records
Features: Includes user behavior patterns, transaction metadata, account profiles, and other relevant indicators.
Approach

The Isolation Forest algorithm was chosen due to its efficiency in handling high-dimensional data and its effectiveness in detecting outliers in unlabeled datasets. Each account is scored based on how easily it can be isolated; accounts with high anomaly scores are flagged as potential mules.

Key Highlights

Unsupervised Learning: No labeled data required, making it suitable for real-world scenarios where mule accounts are rare and labels are scarce.
Scalable & Fast: Performs well with large datasets and high-dimensional inputs.
Interpretability: Provides anomaly scores that can be further analyzed for investigative or operational purposes.
Output

The model produces:

Anomaly scores for each account
Binary classification (normal vs. suspected mule)
A ranked list of high-risk accounts for further investigation
