# MULE-ACCOUNT-IDENTIFICATION-MODEL-USING-ISOLATION-FOREST
This model uses the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect potential mule accounts from a dataset of over 6,667 records. By analyzing user behavior and transaction patterns, the model identifies anomalies that may indicate fraudulent or suspicious activity. It outputs an anomaly score for each account, helping prioritize high-risk profiles.
